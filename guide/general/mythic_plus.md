This page will serve as a comprehensive look into talents, traits, and general dungeon advice for Elemental Shamans. Information on this page is written with the assumption that the rest of the guide has been read in full. If you haven't, we highly recommend reading the priority list, talents, and traits section of the guide before continuing here.

### Talents
We touched on talents for Mythic+ previously in the talents section of the guide. In this section we will be going more in depth to explain each talent selection.

Row 15 | Information
--- | ---
{{site.data.talent.er}} | {{site.data.talent.er}} is the recommended talent on this row if you **DO NOT** have TWO or more {{site.data.azerite.igneous_potential}} equipped. This talent requires no attention, it will simply deal damage passively.
{{site.data.talent.echo}} | {{site.data.talent.echo}} is the recommended talent on this row if you **DO** have TWO or more {{site.data.azerite.igneous_potential}} equipped. This talent will greatly improve your single target and cleave damage, given the proper traits are being used. This talent also synergizes very well with {{site.data.talent.mote}}.
{{site.data.talent.eb}} | {{site.data.talent.eb}} is currently very undertuned, we don't recommend using this talent under any circumstances.
Row 30 | Information
{{ site.data.talent.afs }} | {{site.data.talent.afs}} is the recommended go to talent for dungeons currently. This is a relatively slight loss in single target damage in comparison to {{site.data.talent.tm}}, becomes approximately equal to {{site.data.talent.tm}} on cleave, and becomes superior as more targets become present. This makes {{site.data.talent.afs}} the clear winner in almost every case in dungeon content.
{{site.data.talent.ctt}} | {{site.data.talent.ctt}} is currently undertuned, and as a result will be strictly worse than {{site.data.talent.afs}} in all situations. Because of this, we recommend avoiding it entirely.
{{site.data.talent.tm }} | {{site.data.talent.tm}} is generally inferior to {{site.data.talent.afs}} in dungeons. However, if you need every bit of single target DPS you can get, this is an option. For example, you may consider using this talent in a high level Tyrannical King's Rest key to push out as much boss DPS as possible.
Row 45 | Information
{{site.data.talent.spirit_wolf}} |  {{site.data.talent.spirit_wolf}} is our recommended default talent. You are able to survive some sticky situations with the free 20% damage reduction, and can even kite enemies quite easily with the additional movement speed on top.
{{site.data.talent.earth_shield}} | {{site.data.talent.earth_shield}} is currently quite weak. The heal provided by the shield is minimal and requires frequent GCDs to maintain. We recommend you never use this talent.
{{site.data.talent.static_charge}} | {{site.data.talent.static_charge}} can be situationally useful depending on the dungeon and the composition you are playing with. If you are playing with specs that lack an AoE stun this talent can help pick up the slack. We don't recommend using this talent over {{site.data.talent.spirit_wolf}} often, but it is an okay choice if you feel like you will need it.
Row 60 | Information
{{site.data.talent.mote}} | {{site.data.talent.mote}} is recommended if you **DO** have TWO or more {{site.data.azerite.igneous_potential}} equipped and you are also using {{site.data.talent.echo}}. This talent is by far the best for single target damage, given the proper trait set up and the use of {{site.data.talent.echo}}, this also provides a noticeable increase in AoE damage when used properly to empower {{site.data.spell.eq}}.
{{site.data.talent.se}} | {{site.data.talent.se}} is a very situational talent, if utilized well enough it can provied incredible AoE burst. However, it is very hard to utilize properly, as it requires group coordination and extensive knowledge of the dungeons and the pulls. We recommend inexperienced shamans avoid this talent in dungeons.
{{site.data.talent.lmt}} | {{ site.data.talent.lmt }} is a nice, fairly easy to use AoE damage option. If you are lacking {{site.data.azerite.igneous_potential}} traits, we recommend using this talent instead of {{site.data.talent.mote}}
Row 75 | Information
{{site.data.talent.natures_guardian}} | {{site.data.talent.natures_guardian}} is a convenient and powerful defensive talent that can help you immensely with staying alive. However, {{site.data.talent.ancestral_guidance}} is also very powerful and can help the group stay alive. We generally recommend {{ site.data.talent.natures_guardian }} as the default if you are not comfortable enough with each dungeon to know the optimal times to heal the group. Additionally, we recommend always using {{site.data.talent.natures_guardian}} in Tyrannical King's Rest keys, as nearly every boss has a very dangerous ability that often targets DPS players.
{{site.data.talent.ancestral_guidance}} | {{site.data.talent.ancestral_guidance}} has potential to be incredibly powerful during large AoE pulls when the group is taking high amounts of damage, we recommend taking this talent as soon as you are comfortable enough to survive without {{site.data.talent.natures_guardian}}, and have a feel for the times the group may need additional healing. Something to keep in mind about {{site.data.talent.ancestral_guidance}} is it also heals off of your healing done, not just your damage. This allows you to do a decent amount of healing during single target encounters as well by using {{site.data.spell.healing_surge}}. A little known fact about {{site.data.talent.ancestral_guidance}} is it also does additional healing off of Healthstones and healing potions. If you are low health and use {{site.data.talent.ancestral_guidance}} along with Healthstone, healing potion, and a few healing surges, you can easily do upwards of 400-500k healing.
{{site.data.talent.wind_rush_totem}} | Unless necessary for an elaborate skip, I don't see any situation in which you would need/want {{site.data.talent.wind_rush_totem}} in a dungeon.
Row 90 | Information
{{site.data.talent.sop}} | {{site.data.talent.sop}} is simply not fitting for dungeons, as it requires high uptime and frequent use of {{site.data.spell.es}} to be useful. We recommend you never use this in a dungeon.
{{site.data.talent.pe}} | {{site.data.talent.pe}} is our recommended default choice. This not only empowers your {{site.data.spell.fe}} or {{site.data.spell.se}}, allowing you to do additional damage on AoE. This also empowers your {{site.data.spell.ee}} which can be incredibly powerful in dungeons. We highly recommend communicating with the tank and making liberal use of your empowered {{site.data.spell.ee}}. It is especially powerful on Reaping, as it does not currently take stacks of Reap Soul, allowing it to tank the Reaping enemies even better than a real player tank could. This is often used in order to pull a Reaping in to another pack of mobs.
{{site.data.talent.if}} | {{site.data.talent.if}} will generally be worse than {{site.data.talent.pe}} in dungeons. Not only is {{site.data.talent.if}} primarily useful for single target, whereas {{site.data.talent.pe}} benefits AoE as well. {{site.data.talent.if}} also lacks the controllable {{site.data.spell.ee}}, which can make a huge difference. There could be an argument for {{site.data.talent.if}} in a high Tyrannical Kings Rest, as most of the danger in the instance are single target bosses. However, even here you will severely miss your powerful {{site.data.spell.ee}} on Berserkers (it can soak the bleed), and {{site.data.spell.harden_skin}} for the dangerous bosses.
Row 100 | Information
{{site.data.talent.up}} | {{site.data.talent.up}} suffers heavily from the hidden modifier on {{site.data.spell.cl}}, reducing the overload chance to merely 1/3rd of your mastery. This leaves this talent essentially dead in the water. We recommend avoiding it entirely.
{{site.data.talent.sk}} | {{site.data.talent.sk}} is a very powerful AoE and single target cooldown. We recommend you always use this talent in dungeons, as it is significantly stronger than the alternatives.
{{site.data.talent.asc}} | {{site.data.talent.asc}} is a mediocre single target cooldown and an even weaker AoE cooldown, we recommend avoiding it entirely.

### Traits

Dungeon traits are very similar to raid traits for Elemental Shamans. The sheer power of {{site.data.azerite.igneous_potential}} leaves us wanting three, even in dungeons. The only situations we might consider using less than three {{site.data.azerite.igneous_potential}} in is a Fortified Motherlode key, or a Fortified Teeming Freehold key, simply due to the abundance and importance of AoE.

Along side your {{site.data.azerite.igneous_potential}} traits, any combination of the following traits will do very well in general:
- {{site.data.azerite.natural_harmony}}
- {{site.data.azerite.blightborne_infusion}}
- {{site.data.azerite.treacherous_covenant}}
- {{site.data.azerite.swirling_sands}}

Additionally, {{site.data.azerite.tectonic_thunder}} is a controversial trait. It can be quite powerful for frequent heavy AoE, but it provides nothing for single target. For Fortified this trait will do quite well. However, the main issue with this trait is there are very few pieces of gear with both {{site.data.azerite.igneous_potential}} and {{site.data.azerite.tectonic_thunder}} available at the same time, and there aren't many situations in which you would want to drop an {{site.data.azerite.igneous_potential}} in favor of a {{site.data.azerite.tectonic_thunder}}. The only situation that comes to mind would be a Fortified Motherlode.

                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Priestess Alun'za</span> - Pool Maelstrom for the Spirit of Gold adds, and use {{site.data.spell.capacitor_totem}} or {{site.data.spell.thunderstorm}} to keep the adds away from blood puddles.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Vol'kaal</span> - Pool Maelstrom when applicable to use {{site.data.spell.es}} when you have to move, but do not cap your Maelstrom.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Rezan</span> - Use {{site.data.spell.tremor_totem}} to cleanse every other Terrifying Visage fear cast. If you get eaten during Pursuit, you will be unable to cast damaging spells, so make sure you use {{site.data.spell.healing_surge}} on yourself!</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Yazma</span> - Save {{site.data.talent.stormkeeper}} for the Soulspawn adds, and ensure your group stacks them well to get the most value out of AOE and stuns. The adds can be stunned with {{site.data.spell.capacitor_totem}} and slowed with {{site.data.spell.earthbind_totem}}.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Trash mobs</span> - below are some notes on how to handle the rest of the dungeon:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For Feasting Skyscreamer packs, dump Maelstrom into {{site.data.spell.es}} on the screamers and use {{site.data.spell.cl}} on the small birds to maximize group damage. However, on higher level keys you may want to use {{site.data.spell.eq}} to minimize the danger of the saurids. If you have no interrupts available, you can use {{site.data.spell.tremor_totem}} to dispel the fear. Try to stun with {{site.data.spell.capacitor_totem}} immediately before the birds jump.</li>
                    <li>If you're going the top route to <span class="blue">Vol'kaal</span> first, make sure you have CDs up for the trash pack before the boss. </li>
                    <li>The two Zanchuli Witch-Doctors are especially dangerous. This doesn't impact your damage on <span class="blue">Vol'kaal</span> too much, because the start of the fight is simply attacking the totems.</li>
                    <li>If you're going along the top route to <span class="blue">Priestess Alun'za</span>, purge the Dazar'al Colossus and focus your Maelstrom into it with {{site.data.spell.es}} casts.</li>

                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Skycap'n Kragg</span> - {{site.data.spell.ghost_wolf}} works very well for moving out of Vile Bombardment.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Council o' Captains</span> - Try to pool Maelstrom for Blackout Barrel, as you will need to burst it down very quickly with {{site.data.spell.es}} . Powder Shot can be line-of-sighted with the building next to the boss (use the pillars).</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Ring of Booty</span> - {{site.data.spell.frs}} will be very helpful for damage while moving if you are targeted by a shark. If you have one or more {{site.data.azerite.igneous_potential}} take advantage of the training dummies just outside the boss area, apply {{site.data.spell.fs}} to them for additional {{site.data.spell.lvb}} procs.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Harlan Sweete</span> - Use {{site.data.spell.earthbind_totem}} or {{site.data.spell.capacitor_totem}} on the Irontide Grenadier and he can kill himself away from your group.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Trash mobs</span> - below are some notes on how to handle the rest of the dungeon:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It's generally fine to use CDs on trash before every boss with the exception of <span class="blue">Council o' Captains</span>.</li>
                    <li>Consider priority damage with {{site.data.spell.es}} on the Irontide Enforcers before <span class="blue">Skycap'n Kragg</span> due to the immense tank damage these mobs put out.</li>
                    <li>If you aren't skipping the pack before <span class="blue">Harlan Sweete</span>, you should use cooldowns there as there is no (mechanical) urgency to killing <span class="blue">Harlan Sweete</span> quickly.</li>

                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Mchimba the Embalmber</span> - Use {{site.data.spell.ghost_wolf}} if you're about to be imprisoned to gain stacks of {{site.data.talent.spirit_wolf}}.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">The Council of Tribes</span> - Interrupt as soon as Zanzal the Wise spawns, and purge the Earthwall Totem's shield. Pool Maelstrom before the totems spawn so you can quickly kill the Explosive Totem.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Dazar, the First King</span> - use Tremor Totem to counter the fear from T'zala.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>In <span class="blue">The Golden Serpent</span>'s room, you can have one person interrupt a single mob's Shadow Bolt Volley casts assuming they have a low (~15 sec) cooldown interrupt.</li>
                    <li>On the trash before <span class="blue">Mchimba</span>, use {{site.data.talent.stormkeeper}} as the tank starts to gather slimes. Do not get hit by the swirls, no matter what. With a large pull, getting hit by a single swirl will almost certainly mean your death.</li>
                    <li>In the hallway between <span class="blue">Mchimba</span> and <span class="blue">Council</span>, make sure you use {{site.data.spell.earth_elemental}} to help the tank with damage intake.</li>

                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Aqu'sirr</span> - when the boss splits into three parts, {{site.data.spell.earth_elemental}} can tank one to prevent a Sea Blast cast. With {{site.data.talent.pe}}, your {{site.data.spell.earth_elemental}} can stun Grasp of the Depths</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Tidesage Council </span> - {{site.data.spell.earth_elemental}} can tank Galecaller Faye, making it significantly easier for melee to avoid cleaves and be in range for interrupts, as well as reducing damage to the tank. However, this requires micromanagement of the pet to move Faye out of the Reinforcing Ward.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Lord Stormsong</span> - Using {{site.data.spell.ghost_wolf}} before the mind control allows you to run through orbs at a slightly faster pace. Pool Maelstrom for the mind control in the event it goes on your healer, as you'll want to break it faster.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Vol'Zith the Whispherer</span> - During the add phase, you can interrupt two casts from Forgotten Denizens in a row with some coordination. You will need to interrupt the first one within the first four seconds of the cast and a play with a long interrupt (such as mage or boomkin) will need to interrupt the second one close to the end of the cast. If that is done correctly you will be able to interrupt the second one near the end of its second cast. You can use {{site.data.spell.capacitor_totem}}, {{site.data.spell.earthbind_totem}}, and {{site.data.spell.thunderstorm}} to keep the Manifestation of the Deep adds from reaching the boss.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The damage taken buffer before {{site.data.spell.hex}} breaks is decent,  and using this spell on the Templars throughout the dungeon can significantly help the tank and healer.</li>
                    <li>Water Walking helps reach the final boss approximately 3 seconds faster (we didn't actually time this, sorry).</li>

                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Dread Captain Lockwood</span> - Keep {{site.data.spell.earthbind_totem}} down on the boss to keep her from jumping around due to her mechanic called Evasive.

                    <li>Krolusk Riders apply a lightning shield to themselves, which should be purged ASAP.</li>

If two Earthragers fixate to the same area, you can use {{site.data.spell.thunderstorm}} to knock them closer to the boss for added cleave.</p>

                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Elder Leaxa</span> - The boss ramps up very hard, and you will want to have cooldowns for this boss.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Cragmaw the Infested</span> - There's a ton of movement in this fight, so try to pool Maelstrom to have an extra GCD of movement when soaking the larva.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Sporecaller Zancha</span> - If your group is overwhelmed by spores and you desperately need to clear, just run through as many as possible and use Ankh. Upheaval does quite a bit of damage, so save {{site.data.spell.astral_shift}} and spec {{site.data.talent.spirit_wolf}} if you're afraid you might get one-shot. You can technically dodge it but without burst mobility if you are not far from the boss it will be unreliable.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Unbound Abomination</span> - {{site.data.spell.cl}} is exceptional for clearing spores and generation Maelstrom.</p>

Upheavel can get out of control pretty quickly, so consider using {{site.data.talent.spirit_wolf}} to survive. Save {{site.data.talent.stormkeeper}} for drone spawns, and don't bother with {{site.data.spell.earthquake}} on these unless it's a Necrotic week or Tyrannical week.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Jes Howlis</span> - During the second phase anyone can interrupt Bobby on his stun even before the shield is broken. Be ready to tremor totem if there are no available ranged interrupts and Bobby runs away to cast his fear.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Knight Captain Valyri</span> - {{site.data.spell.ghost_wolf}} makes moving barrels quite easy. Move two of the closest barrels out of the room before pulling the boss to make the start easier.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Overseer Korgus</span> - Positioning is key in this fight, but there are no elemental specific tips.</p>

                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Heartsbane Triad</span> - you can dispel Runic Mark, so communicate with your healer if you want to dispel it or not as it deals damage upon expiration or removal. Make sure to purge buffs from your friends if they are mind controlled, especially if it's a big cooldown like Bloodlust or Icy Veins, as they will finally admit that you play the better class.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Soulbound Goliath</span> - Pool Maelstrom to kill Soul Thorns.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Raal the Gluttonous</span> - {{site.data.spell.chain_lightning}} works very well on this boss, as his hitbox is very large you can reliably hit every expulsion and any servants that get close.</p>
                <p markdown="1"><span class="blue">Lord and Lady Waycrest</span> - If you have one or more {{spell.data.azerite.igneous_potential}} you can stand near the edge of the room and apply {{site.data.spell.fs}} to Lady Waycrest throughout the encounter for more {{site.data.spell.lvb}} procs. There is a barrier there so don't worry about falling off. </p>
