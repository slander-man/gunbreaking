                <p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/elemental/c9Dc">2333123</a>. You can swap {{site.data.talent.static_charge}} for {{site.data.talent.spirit_wolf}} if you're concerned about damage intake when dropping blood.</p>
                <h4>Playstyle</h4>
                <p>This boss is mostly single target with frequent but unimportant add spawns, the off tank will likely soak all of these adds for you so you have no need to touch them. During phase 2 when the boss goes to the center you will be attempting to kill 1-2 large bloods while avoiding the small bloods, you can still hit the boss and small bloods with {{site.data.spell.cl}}.</p>
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Phase 1 - Pure single target with moderate movement.</li>
                    <li>Phase 2 - Funnelling on 1-2 targets with the ability to generate Maelstrom on up to 5.</li>
                    <li>Phase 3 - Same as phase 1.</li>

                <h4>Talent recommendations</h4>
                <p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/elemental/cxDc">2313123</a> if you're in the boss group. <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/elemental/cxDM">2333122</a> if you're in the add group. {{site.data.talent.wind_rush_totem}} is also an option (for either group).</p>
                <h4>Playstyle</h4>
                <p>This boss appears complicated at a glance, but once broken down is quite simple. There are 3 rooms in the fight, you will start in room 1, your goal is to reach room 3 as soon as possible. When a member of the raid crosses to the next room they will spawn an add that begins casting almost immediately. If this cast gets off it is very bad so you need to control these adds. Crossing also does raid damage so only a few can cross at a time.</p>
                <p>Members who cross will be unable to attack the boss until the boss crosses as well, so their sole purpose is to control and kill adds as they appear. As an Elemental Shaman you will most likely be designated to cross very early due to your burst AOE, stun, and low CD interrupt. If you are crossing early you will want to spec accordingly, {{site.data.talent.sk}} is very good for the burst AoE and {{site.data.talent.tm}} shines with its ability to top your maelstrom during the downtime. You will also want to take advantage of the time you have before the adds spawn by dropping {{site.data.talent.lmt}} and an {{site.data.spell.eq}} as you see them reach the middle of the room, additionally you will want to precast {{site.data.talent.sk}}.</p>
                <p>If you are crossing late you will want to spec for pure single target, as your primary concern will be boss damage.</p>
                <p>There is not a whole lot else going on with this fight, while the boss is in room 1 it’s very light movement aside from heavy movement due to the winds/fire. While the boss is in room 2 lasers are introduced as well, adding additional movement. Room 3 is the same as room 1 and 2, except now the boss will take additional damage. You will want to have cooldowns up with {{site.data.spell.bloodlust}} for room 3 if possible, but don’t sacrifice your add damage for this. Once the entire group is in room 3 the fight should be pretty simple from there.</p>
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>This boss splits the raid up a bit and you should spec according to your assignment. All phases have periods of relatively high movement. Save CDs for the increased damage taken on boss in phase 3. </p>

                <h4>Talent recommendations</h4>
                <p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/elemental/cxDc">2313123</a> - {{site.data.talent.wind_rush_totem}} could also see use</p>
                <h4>Playstyle</h4>
                <p>This boss is mostly patchwerk with a large knockback every once in a while, the only way for a shaman to stop the knockback is to use a portal or be against a wall. We recommend {{site.data.talent.spirit_wolf}} if you are not confident you can stop the knockback, as it is VERY far. There are also adds that spawn that need to be killed, they do not move and have a decent amount of health, 3 at a time. They are far from each other so you will never be able to cleave on them aside from add to boss. At 50% health the boss begins to take and deal more damage, this is when you lust and ideally have CDs.</p>
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>Fairly light movement, almost purely single target. Big knockback that you should be near a wall for, and occasional add spawns that take priority over boss. Boss takes additional damage below 50% health.</p>

                <h4>Talent recommendations</h4>
                <p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/elemental/cxDM">2313122</a> - {{site.data.talent.storm_elemental}} can be excellent, but only if it can be used on both Silithid spawns. This is unlikely to be the case for Heroic.</p>
                <h4>Playstyle</h4>
                <p>This boss has frequent add waves of different types:</p>
                <ul><li>Silithid - Fixates players, very large spawn that are mostly stacked, absolutely save CDs for this.</li>
                <li>Nerubian - 3 spawn in different locations and all begin to cast on random targets, the cast really hurts but can be interrupted. Outside of Normal you cannot move these adds at all.</li></ul>
                <p>This fight cycles between periods of no movement and periods of heavy movement. In the last phase there is a purple orb that players can catch for a 100% damage and healing buff, after 20 seconds the buff expires and the player becomes mind controlled. On mythic in order to break the mind control you must kill the target, so if you have ankh available you are a good candidate to go first. If you know when you are going, try to have CDs for it.</p>
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>This fight has a lot of adds and a good amount of intermittent movement, save CDs for adds, in particular save {{site.data.talent.stormkeeper}} and {{site.data.talent.lmt}} for Silithids when applicable, and interrupt nerubians as much as possible. Also try to have CDs for the pre-mind-control buff that increases your damage by 100%</p>

                <h4>Playstyle</h4>
                <p>This boss is basically patchwerk when he’s up as far as movement goes. There will be 1 add spawning occasionally that needs to die asap, try to pool maelstrom for this. Stay in {{site.data.spell.ghost_wolf}} to take advantage of {{site.data.talent.spirit_wolf}} for the intermission unless you need to cast a heal.</p>
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>Very light movement, almost pure single target boss with a large phase of downtime that makes {{site.data.talent.spirit_wolf}} shine.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/elemental/cxDM">2313122</a> - {{site.data.talent.static_charge}} is also an option for more frequent stuns, and {{site.data.talent.storm_elemental}} if you want higher burst damage for a particular part of the fight.</p>
                <h4>Playstyle</h4>
                <p>This boss has a lot of adds that are often stacked; you can {{site.data.spell.cl}} on the Crawgs while using {{site.data.spell.es}} to kill the Crusher or Bloodhexer. If the tank is having issues surviving the Crawgs you should consider swapping to using {{site.data.spell.eq}} instead. If a Minion of Zul reaches it’s fixated player it will fear the player; {{site.data.spell.tremor_totem}} does remove this fear, but only one stack at a time (if multiple adds hit the player gets multiple stacks). In phase 2 there is an additional fear called Deathwish, and {{site.data.spell.tremor_totem}} does NOT remove this fear. All throughout this fight there is a very high amount of movement, especially in phase 2.</p>
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>Heavy AOE fight with priority targets, heavy movement, uses for {{site.data.spell.purge}} and {{site.data.spell.tremor_totem}}.</p>

                <h4>Talent recommendations</h4>
                <p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/elemental/cxDc">2313123</a> - If you need more add damage, {{site.data.talent.stormkeeper}} is an option, but you lose out on a lot of boss damage. If you need group healing, consider {{site.data.talent.ancestral_guidance}} for the intermission.</p>
                <h4>Playstyle</h4>
                <p>This boss is light movement, full single target aside from 2 intermissions. Orbs spawn that will mind control players within its range, and damage pushes the players away from the source of the damage. It takes about 3 hits to fully push someone out of the orb -- {{site.data.spell.thunderstorm}} also works to knock them completely out. Elemental is good and bad at this since you can spam {{site.data.spell.frost_shock}} or apply {{site.data.spell.flame_shock}} to quickly knock players out, but they do maintain the {{site.data.spell.flame_shock}} or {{site.data.spell.frost_shock}} debuffs when no longer mind controlled. During intermission there will be 2 priority targets that are far away from each other, and 5-10 low priority adds right on top of the priority target (it spawns on players so you need to stack to get this effect). Unless you are having problems surviving the casts from the small adds you should focus on funneling damage into the big add. {{site.data.talent.ancestral_guidance}} could see some use during the intermission phase, a lot of raid damage is happening here and you are able to AoE to get full benefit from {{site.data.talent.ancestral_guidance}}. {{site.data.talent.spirit_wolf}} is excellent for running debuffs out.
</p>
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>Light movement, primarily single target boss with 2 sets of adds that include a priority target. {{site.data.spell.frost_shock}} is great for breaking people from orbs but also leaves them slowed for a few seconds.</p>

                <h4>Talent recommendations</h4>
                <p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/elemental/cxDM">2313122</a> - there is a lot of potential for {{site.data.talent.static_charge}} and {{site.data.talent.wind_rush_totem}} to shine, too.</p>
                <h4>Playstyle</h4>
                <p>This fight has a lot of different movement types, damage profiles, and mechanics to it.</p>
                <p>Phase 1: Tons of tentacles that need to be interrupted; ensure you use {{site.data.spell.wind_shear}} on cooldown. Don’t hit the dark young if possible as you want to keep it for the damage buff. If you can’t hit at least 3 high health tentacles with {{site.data.spell.eq}} just {{site.data.spell.es}} the primary tentacle while continuing to interrupt the small ones. This phase is moderately high movement.</p>
                <p>Phase 2: G’huun comes out of his hole and the adds go away, you spread and stand still majority of this phase. Occasionally a debuff comes that you need to stack for that also spawns an add that needs to be killed. This phase is very simple for DPS. Low movement phase.</p>
                <p>Phase 3: This phase includes giant circles you need to dodge at the start, mushrooms you need to dance on (move to small ones until big blow up, then move back to safe zone), as well as a fear if you are facing him during the cast ({{site.data.spell.tremor_totem}} works on this). Explosive Corruption continues, and there are now ground effects that slow and hurt you. You shouldn’t ever have to {{site.data.spell.tremor_totem}} in theory, but keep an eye on your raid frames to see if anyone is feared so you can quickly cleanse them with the totem. There are no adds during this phase. Very high movement.</p>
                <p>Upstairs: Upstairs is referring to orb running, this will be happening throughout phase 1 and 2. Elemental really shines upstairs as it has {{site.data.spell.ghost_wolf}} to prevent the slow until it becomes a root and it has really good self sustain. {{site.data.talent.stormkeeper}} is also excellent for clearing the slows. I highly recommend {{site.data.talent.spirit_wolf}} talent and Pack Spirit Azerite trait, with this you should be able to spare all of your heals for your partner and keep him alive without the help of a real healer. If you find that you’re doing fine on health up there, {{site.data.talent.wind_rush_totem}} is probably quite useful to assure you get it in 1 toss.</p>
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>Elemental Shamans primary goal on this fight is utility and mechanics, and you’re very good at it. Make use of {{site.data.spell.wind_shear}}, {{site.data.spell.healing_surge}}, {{site.data.spell.tremor_totem}}, and {{site.data.spell.ghost_wolf}}. </p>
